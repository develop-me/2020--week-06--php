## Challenges

Create a new file for each challenge. If a code block is provided, copy the provided code and then add your own code in the `// ... your code here` bit.

1) FizzBuzz

    - write some code that will output the numbers 1 to 100 in the console
    - *unless* the number is divisible by 3, in which case output "Fizz"
    - *or* the number is divisible by 5, in which case output "Buzz"
    - *if* the number is divisible by 3 *and* 5, output "FizzBuzz"

    The first lines of output should look like this:

    ```bash
    1
    2
    Fizz
    4
    Buzz
    Fizz
    7
    8
    Fizz
    Buzz
    11
    Fizz
    13
    14
    FizzBuzz
    16
    ...
    ```

    You'll want to use `echo` to get clean output, but make sure you add "\n" on the end of each line, otherwise they will all appear on one line.

    ```
    echo $i + "\n";
    ```

    Feel free to use your JavaScript solution as a guide (or even copy and paste it, then update the syntax).

    Having already solved this in JavaScript, you shouldn't have to rethink any of the logic - just the syntax.

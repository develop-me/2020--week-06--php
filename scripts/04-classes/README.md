# Day 2: Morning

## Classes

### Basic Usage
- Often useful to have objects that represent the same sort of thing
    - Same properties
    - Same methods
    - **different** values
    - e.g. a "Mark" object and a "Ben" object
- A class is an abstract representation of an object
- Lets us create "instances"
- e.g. `Person` class lets us create instances representing different people
- Demo Person class
- Demonstrate using: `->` instead of `.`
- Mention PSR-2 Style

### Properties
- Demonstrate properties
    - Use `private` - will explain later
    - Use getters and setters - will explain later
    - Default values

### `$this`
- Demonstrate using `$this`

### Constructor

- Takes values passed from `new`
- Stores values on properties
- Don't need for default values
- Not necessary if not passing anything in and no setup to do

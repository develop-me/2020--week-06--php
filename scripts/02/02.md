# Day 2: Afternoon

## Classes

### Basic Usage
- A class is an abstract representation of an object instance
- e.g. `Person` class lets us create instances representing different people
- Demo Person class
- Similar to JS: except visibility and properties
- No closing tags
- Mention PSR-2 Style
- Demonstrate using: `->` instead of `.`

### `$this`
- Demonstrate using `$this`
- Demonstrate chaining

### Properties
- Demonstrate properties: with defaults and without

### Visibility
- private, public, protected
- should always use private for properties

## Static
- Makes it clear that function is about that type of thing
- Person::lastNames() method
- Can't use `$this` in `static`, so no `private` access
- Paamayim Nekudotayim: `::`
- Show `static` keyword: breakout last name map into separate function
- Mention `self`: `static` - called in, `self` - written in
- `static` properties: useful for caching

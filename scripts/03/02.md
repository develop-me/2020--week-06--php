# Day 3: Afternoon


## OOP
- So far everything procedural
- Need state in bigger apps
- Object-Oriented Programming is one solution
- Encapsulation: keep related properties and methods in one places
- Black boxes passing messages
- PHP wasn't really OO until 2009, hence older systems/libraries

### Classes
- We can use classes/objects to store related data
    - `sendMail($to, $from, $message)` function - but need more options
    - `sendMail()` using globals - yuck
    - `Mail->send()` using an object
- Need to start using objects somewhere, bootstrap file - get stuff going and include autoload
- Law of Demeter

### Types
- An object of class X, can be thought of has being the X type
- Type declaration in methods/functions
- e.g. `MailingList->sendWith(Mail $mail)`
- Try sending in wrong sort of thing
- Not much good, as limited to `Mail` class

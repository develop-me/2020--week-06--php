## To Do

- Quiz
    * [ ] Basic class
    * [ ] Class with chaining
    * [ ] Class that accepts same type of class
    * [ ] Class that accepts another class
    * [ ] Interface
    * [ ] Inheritance
    * [ ] Three level interface interaction (e.g. Library, Shelf, Book)
- Interfaces challenges
    * [ ] Recreate Bike challenge using classes for everything
- Some more basic static challenges
- More on static
    * [ ] Explain better
    * [ ] Include example of using `People` instead - better type safety but harder for other people to use
- OOP: Keep objects as objects for as long as possible
- Demonstrate creating collection in constructor
- When to use a constructor
    * [ ] If excepting arguments
    * [ ] If setting something up (e.g. collect)
- Pre-week reading, to get through basic-PHP stuff and regex in one day?
- Rewrite Law of Demeter
- Explain when to use interfaces
    > When you write a class that takes an object as an argument to a method
- More regex challenges
    * [ ] preg_split
    * [ ] preg_replace
    * [ ] Tricksy: back references
- Cover capture groups in `preg_replace`
- Typed properties (PHP 7.4+)
- Guide to writing classes
    * [ ] Does it accept arguments: __construct
    * [ ] Does it need default values?
    * [ ] What methods does it need?
- Inheritance challenge with two parts: a) use inheritance b) use composition
- Mention use partial namespace with `use` - e.g. `App\Cutlery` so you can then do `new Cutlerty\Spoon()`
- `lastName` method used in static section of notes, but not actually in Person class

## Doing


## Done

- Type hinting arrays, scalars
- Git repos to get setup for the challenges
- Cover encapsulation earlier - with objects?
- Cover flags in regex
- Mention brackets for grouping specifically in regex
- Interfaces before Inheritance
    * [x] Always use interfaces for polymorphism
    * [x] Only use inheritance for definitely shared behaviour
- Talk about return type declarations
    * [x] Clear up type hint vs type declaration
- Mention single responsibility principle in OOP notes
- Is static necessary for caching in recipe static question? Just stored as a property
- Architecture before OOP
- Namespace challenges need clearer setup instructions to make sure they're doing it properly
- Move static to post-encapsulation?
- Update autoloading challenges so no chaining or objects using other objects
    * [x] Move spares into OOP/static
    * [x] Add namespaces to OOP/static challenges
- OOP Challenges
    * [x] Add template repo
    * [x] Should use autoloading
- Separate static challengs and point to right place
    * [x] Add static challenge to use a collection class (People) instead of static

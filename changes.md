## To Do

- Easy static challenge on day 2
- Interfaces before Inheritance
    * [ ] Always use interfaces for polymorphism
    * [ ] Only use inheritance for definitely shared behaviour
    * [ ] Clear up Mammal inheritance example: e.g. lactation, all mammals do, except males
- Talk about return type declarations
    * [ ] Clear up type hint vs type declaration
- Guide to writing classes
    * [ ] Does it accept arguments: __construct
    * [ ] Does it need default values?
    * [ ] What methods does it need?
- Inheritance challenge with two parts: a) use inheritance b) use composition
- Better static property example in script
- Mention use partial namespace with `use` - e.g. `App\Cutlery` so you can then do `new Cutlerty\Spoon()`
- Talk about `unsigned()` integers in foreign key stuff
- Cover "bootstrap" file in more detail in Namespaces
- Rewrite notes on autoloading - which file it goes in, etc.
- `lastName` method used in static section of notes, but not actually in Person class

## Doing

- More easy challenges day 3

## To Do

- Need to demonstrate `require` at least once in notes about namespaces
- Mention single responsibility principle in OOP notes
- Explain when to use interfaces
    > When you write a class that takes an object as an argument to a method
- More regex challenges
    * [ ] preg_split
    * [ ] preg_replace
    * [ ] Tricksy: back references
- Cover capture groups in `preg_replace`
- Typed properties (PHP 7.4+)
- Guide to writing classes
    * [ ] Does it accept arguments: __construct
    * [ ] Does it need default values?
    * [ ] What methods does it need?
- Inheritance challenge with two parts: a) use inheritance b) use composition
- Mention use partial namespace with `use` - e.g. `App\Cutlery` so you can then do `new Cutlerty\Spoon()`
- `lastName` method used in static section of notes, but not actually in Person class

## Doing


## Done

- Type hinting arrays, scalars
- Git repos to get setup for the challenges
- Cover encapsulation earlier - with objects?
- Cover flags in regex
- Mention brackets for grouping specifically in regex
- Interfaces before Inheritance
    * [x] Always use interfaces for polymorphism
    * [x] Only use inheritance for definitely shared behaviour
- Talk about return type declarations
    * [x] Clear up type hint vs type declaration

## To Do

- Explain when to use interfaces
    > When you write a class that takes an object as an argument to a method
- Mention "Ad hoc" polymorphism
    > Not use type declaration - will still work, but not guaranteed encapsulation
- Update ints to floats in function (01/02) challenges where appropriate
- Git repos to get setup for the challenges
- Cover encapsulation earlier - with objects?
- Need to cover types with initial Classes stuff
- Rejig the challenges
    * [ ] Person challenge (day 3, 02) shouldn't be further on - encapsulation?
- Finish adding types to answers
- More easy challenges day 3
    * [ ] Namespaces/Composer
    * [ ] OOP
- Cover flags in regex
- More regex challenges
    * [ ] preg_split
    * [ ] preg_replace
    * [ ] Tricksy: back references
- Cover back references in `preg_replace`
- Mention brackets for grouping specifically in regex
- Easy static challenge on day 2
- Typed properties (PHP 7.4+)
- Interfaces before Inheritance
    * [ ] Always use interfaces for polymorphism
    * [ ] Only use inheritance for definitely shared behaviour
    * [ ] Clear up Mammal inheritance example: e.g. lactation, all mammals do, except males
- Talk about return type declarations
    * [ ] Clear up type hint vs type declaration
- Guide to writing classes
    * [ ] Does it accept arguments: __construct
    * [ ] Does it need default values?
    * [ ] What methods does it need?
- Inheritance challenge with two parts: a) use inheritance b) use composition
- Better static property example in script
- Mention use partial namespace with `use` - e.g. `App\Cutlery` so you can then do `new Cutlerty\Spoon()`
- Cover "bootstrap" file in more detail in Namespaces
- Rewrite notes on autoloading - which file it goes in, etc.
- `lastName` method used in static section of notes, but not actually in Person class

## Doing


## Done

- Type hinting arrays, scalars
